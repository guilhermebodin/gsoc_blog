Hello!

Excited for working with NumFOCUS as a GSoC student. I will be working on an automatic dualization feature for JuMP, I hope during the summer, well... winter in Brazil, I can share with you some of the exciting programs we can write once it is all done.

For now, my mentors and I started a gitter channel to discuss the project steps and deliverables. As a good open source project, the [chatroom](https://gitter.im/AutomaticDualization/community#) is public for everyone!

Stay with the picture I suggested as a logo for the project. It represents the dual space of JuMP logo ;)
