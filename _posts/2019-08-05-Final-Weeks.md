Hello!

We are now in the last weeks, some community members are already using it and giving feedback about the package. Thank you @dourouc05 and @matbesancon.

Our focus is to build proper documentation with examples.  Once we have it, we can decide if the package is going to be moved to the JuliaOpt organization or not. Another important point is that we plan to Register the package, so it is easier to use.

The features offered by the package are exciting, and the development will undoubtedly continue after GSOC. :)
