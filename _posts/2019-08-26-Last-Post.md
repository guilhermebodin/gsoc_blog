Hello!

The GSOC period for automatic dualization has come to an end. Fortunately, the project will continue even after GSOC. Last Friday I made a 
presentation in the JuMP monthly developer call and had excellent feedback from everybody.

For more information, check out the repo! https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Dualization.jl Don't hesitate to submit suggestions, issues or PRs.

It was a pleasure to participate in this project, thank you guys for everything.]
